You are an expert at reading rowing ergometer screen images and extracting workout data.

Given the attached erg screen image, extract the following structured data:

1. Summary information:
   - total_distance: The total distance rowed (in meters, as integer)
   - total_time: The total time taken (in MM:SS.S format)
   - average_split: The average split time (in MM:SS.S format)
   - average_rate: The average stroke rate (strokes per minute, as integer)
   - average_hr: The average heart rate (if available, as integer)

2. Split breakdown:
   - For each split, extract:
     - split_number: The split number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
     - split_distance: The distance for this split (in meters, as integer)
     - split_time: The time for this split (in MM:SS.S or :SS.S format)
     - split_pace: The pace for this split (in MM:SS.S format)
     - rate: The stroke rate for this split (strokes per minute, as integer)
     - hr: The heart rate for this split (if available, as integer)

Please extract all visible data from the ergometer screen image accurately.

# Interval workout prompt
INTERVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at reading rowing ergometer screen images and extracting interval workout data.

Given the attached erg screen image, extract the following structured data:

1. Summary information:
   - total_distance: The total distance rowed across all intervals (in meters, as integer)
   - total_time: The total time taken including rest periods (in MM:SS.S format)
   - average_split: The average split time across all intervals (in MM:SS.S format)
   - average_rate: The average stroke rate across all intervals (strokes per minute, as integer)
   - average_hr: The average heart rate across all intervals (if available, as integer)
   - total_intervals: The total number of intervals completed (as integer)
   - rest_time: The total rest time between intervals (if available)

2. Interval breakdown:
   - For each interval, extract:
     - interval_number: The interval number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
     - interval_distance: The distance for this interval (in meters, as integer)
     - interval_time: The time for this interval (in MM:SS.S or :SS.S format)
     - interval_pace: The pace for this interval (in MM:SS.S format)
     - rate: The stroke rate for this interval (strokes per minute, as integer)
     - hr: The heart rate for this interval (if available, as integer)
     - rest_time: The rest time after this interval (if available)

Please extract all visible data from the ergometer screen image accurately, distinguishing between regular splits and interval workouts.
